Overview
--------

This directory tree contains the source code for a library of parameterized RTL 
components that was originally developed in the context of the CVA Open-Source 
Network-on-Chip Router RTL [1,2]; we hope that it might prove useful for other 
applications as well.

It includes the following subdirectories:

src/   - The actual component implementations.
utils/ - Code generators for optimized implementations of several components.
verif/ - Verification testbenches.

For contact information and instructions on how to obtain the most up-to-date 
version of this code, please consult [2].
